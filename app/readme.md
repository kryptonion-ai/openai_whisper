# React Whisper Transcription App

This React application integrates with the Whisper ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system to provide real-time transcription capabilities. Users can initiate and control the recording process, and the transcribed text is displayed dynamically. Additionally, there's an option to send the transcript to a specified API endpoint.

## Features

- **Real-time Recording:** Start, pause, and stop the recording process with easy-to-use buttons.

- **Transcription Status:** Monitor the status of recording, speaking, and transcribing in real-time.

- **Dynamic Transcript Display:** View the transcribed text as it is generated by the Whisper ASR system.

- **Send Transcript:** Send the transcribed text to a designated API endpoint for further processing.

- **User Feedback:** Receive feedback on the success of transcript submission.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   npm install
