# Whisper ASR Integration: React and Flask

This project seamlessly integrates the Whisper ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) system with both a React front-end and a Flask back-end, providing a complete solution for real-time transcription of audio recordings. The React application allows users to control the recording process, view transcribed text dynamically, and send the transcript to the Flask API for further processing.

## React Whisper Transcription App

### Features

- **Real-time Recording:** Initiate, pause, and stop the recording process using user-friendly buttons.

- **Transcription Status:** Monitor real-time status updates for recording, speaking, and transcribing.

- **Dynamic Transcript Display:** View transcribed text as it is generated by the Whisper ASR system.

- **Send Transcript:** Submit the transcribed text to the Flask API endpoint (`http://0.0.0.0:5001/transcribe`) for additional processing.

- **User Feedback:** Receive feedback on the successful submission of the transcript.

### Getting Started

1. **Installation:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configuration:**

   - Replace `YOUR_OPEN_AI_TOKEN` in the `useWhisper` hook with your actual OpenAI API key.
   - Set the API endpoint URL in the `fetch` call inside the `sendTranscript` function to `http://0.0.0.0:5001/transcribe`.

3. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Usage:**
   - Open the application in your browser.
   - Click the "Start" button to initiate recording.
   - Use "Pause" and "Stop" buttons as needed.
   - View the transcribed text in real-time.
   - Click "Send Transcript" to submit the transcription to the `http://0.0.0.0:5001/transcribe` API endpoint.

### Dependencies

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Whisper ASR: An Automatic Speech Recognition system for transcribing spoken language.
- OpenAI Whisper: The application uses the OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text capabilities.

### Customization

- **Whisper Configuration:** Adjust settings in the `useWhisper` hook for streaming, timeSlice, etc.
- **Styling:** Customize the styling in the React components to match your application's design.

### Notes

- Ensure that the OpenAI API key is kept secure and not shared publicly.
- The provided code is a basic example and may require additional error handling and security measures for a production environment.

## Flask Whisper API

### Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Whisper ASR Model
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors whisper
   ```

3. Download the Whisper ASR model and place it in the project directory.

### Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. The server will be accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:5001/`.

3. Test the API by sending a POST request to the `/transcribe` endpoint with an audio file attached.

   Example using `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -F "audio=@path/to/your/audio/file.wav" http://0.0.0.0:5001/transcribe
   ```

   Replace `"path/to/your/audio/file.wav"` with the actual path to your audio file.

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Transcribe Audio

- **Endpoint:** `/transcribe`
- **Method:** POST
- **Parameters:**
  - `audio`: The audio file to be transcribed (multipart/form-data)
- **Response:**
  - Successful response returns the transcribed text.

#### 2. Hello World

- **Endpoint:** `/`
- **Method:** GET
- **Response:**
  - Returns a simple "HelloWorld!" message.

#### CORS Configuration

- The application is configured to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from different origins.

### Directory Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file.
- `audio/`: Directory to store temporarily uploaded audio files.

### Notes

- The Whisper ASR model should be downloaded and placed in the project directory.
- The server runs on `http://0.0.0.0:5001/` by default.

Feel free to customize and extend this project based on your specific requirements.
